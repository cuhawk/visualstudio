Versions < 1.290 are vulnerable to LFI- as the process runs under root privilege
  Can access root SSH key information or view /etc/passwd and crack with John
  
If this succeeds, we either have root access or the ability to execute code as root (due to having access to a normal user account)
  Upload a pl file and execute via the LFI vuln.
